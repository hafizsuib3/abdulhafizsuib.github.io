**[Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/hafizsuib3/water-quality-app)**

![Water Quality Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hafizsuib3/water-quality-app/main/Water%20Banner.png)

- Utilized machine learning (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, MLP) to classify sustainable accommodations in Malaysia.
- Scraped, preprocessed, and feature-selected OTA data from 17,866 samples, optimizing model performance.
- Created an interactive Streamlit app for sustainability predictions.

**[Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-app)**  

![Twitter Sentiment Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hafizsuib3/twitter-sentiment-analysis/main/Sentiment.png)

- Developed a sentiment classification pipeline using the **Sentiment140 dataset** (1.6M tweets, sampled 200k).  
- Preprocessed tweets (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal) and extracted features with **TF-IDF**.  
- Benchmarked multiple models (**Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest**) and selected the best with **weighted F1-score**.  
- Saved trained artifacts (`sentiment_model.pkl`, `tfidf.pkl`) for deployment.  
- Prepared framework for a future **Streamlit app** enabling real-time tweet sentiment predictions.
