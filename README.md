**[Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/hafizsuib3/water-quality-app)**

![Water Quality Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hafizsuib3/water-quality-app/main/Water%20Banner.png)

- Built a machine learning pipeline to classify **Water Quality Index (WQI)** into categories **Aâ€“E** using physicochemical and microbiological parameters.  
- Trained and benchmarked multiple models (**SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP**) and selected the best based on test accuracy.  
- Applied **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance and improve recognition of minority WQI classes.  
- Deployed the trained model as a **Streamlit web app**, allowing user to enter inputs and instantly obtain prediction of WQI classes.

**[Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-app)**  

![Twitter Sentiment Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hafizsuib3/twitter-sentiment-analysis/main/Sentiment.png)

- Developed a sentiment classification pipeline using the **Sentiment140 dataset** (1.6M tweets, sampled 200k).  
- Preprocessed tweets (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal) and extracted features with **TF-IDF**.  
- Benchmarked multiple models (**Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest**) and selected the best with **weighted F1-score**.  
- Saved trained artifacts (`sentiment_model.pkl`, `tfidf.pkl`) for deployment.
